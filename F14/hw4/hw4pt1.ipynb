      "For this Homework, we'll explore Machine Learning at scale. Much of the recent focus on scaling machine learning has been on cluster computing, without much attention to single-machine performance. It turns out that there is a lot of mileage in optimizing single-machine performance for machine learning, especially leveraging inexpensive GPUs. In fact single-node hardware holds the record for most common machine learning tasks. See this <a href=\"https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMach/wiki/Benchmarks\">collection of recent benchmarks</a>. There are several steps to getting high performance on single machines:\n",
      "* \"rooflining\" or optimizing the performance of each kernel against the theoretical limits imposed by memory or the chip's arithmetic units. \n",
      "* Rooflined GPU kernels: there is even more headroom for improvements in machine learning algorithms on graphics processors. \n",
      "* Efficient optimization: Fast optimization (SGD with ADAGRAD or fast coordinate ascent) can add another order of magnitude or more of performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these can contribute an order-of-magnitude or more of speedup. With the tools you've used so far and modest hardware of your own or in the cloud, you can tackle problems at the frontier of scale for machine learning. First lets initialize BIDMach as usual."

      "* <b>Cross-validated log likelihood</b> shows the log likelihood on the most recent held-out minibatch of data. The same minibatches are held out on each pass over the dataset, so that training and test data are not mixed. \n",
      "* <b>gigaflops</b> how many billion arithmetic operations per second the algorithm is completing. Algorithms vary in the number of operations they require, but for a fixed algorithm this is an easy measure to compare performance. There are also \"roofline\" limits for the dominant operations in each algorithm and a particular kind of hardware. The roofline for sparse-dense matrix multiply (the dominant step in logistic regression) is 20-30 gflops for this GPU model, and around 6 gflops for the CPU. You can compare those numbers to see if the algorithm could possibly be optimized any more. \n",
      "* <b>secs</b> is the total elapsed seconds for this training run. \n",
      "* <b>GB</b> the total number of Gigabytes of input data that has been read or re-read during training. \n",
      "* <b>MB/s</b> the data read rate, which is just the quotient of total input bytes by time. This is an important measure because it shows how well the I/O system is doing, and will be the limiting factor for tasks that are not too compute-intensive. Standard disks can manage up to 200 MB/s. SSDs, which are attached to this Amazon instance, can manage up to 500 MB/s. Since BIDMach uses very fast file compression (lz4) you will sometimes see values several times higher than this. That happens because the uncompressed data rate is several times the rate of compressed data coming off the disk. \n",
